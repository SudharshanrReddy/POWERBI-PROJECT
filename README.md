# DATA PROFESSIONAL SURVEY BREAKDOWN

## Project Overview

The "DATA PROFESSIONAL SURVEY BREAKDOWN" project involves an in-depth analysis of raw data collected from working data professionals. This survey aims to gather insights on various aspects of the data profession, including job titles, salaries, favorite programming languages, work-life balance, and the perceived challenges of entering the data field.

## Data Collection

The data was collected through a survey distributed to professionals currently working in the data industry. Participants provided valuable information that reflects their experiences and opinions regarding their roles and the industry as a whole.

## Visualizations

Using Power BI, I created a series of interactive visualizations that effectively communicate the findings from the survey. These visualizations highlight trends and correlations between different factors, providing a clearer understanding of the data landscape. Key questions explored include:

- What are the most common job titles in the data profession?
- How do salaries vary across different roles and regions?
- What programming languages do professionals prefer?
- How do professionals perceive their work-life balance?
- What challenges do newcomers face when entering the data field?

## Conclusion

This project not only enhances my skills in data visualization and analysis but also contributes to the broader understanding of the data profession. The findings can be beneficial for both aspiring data professionals and organizations looking to attract and retain talent in this rapidly evolving field. 

Feel free to explore the visualizations and dive into the data!
